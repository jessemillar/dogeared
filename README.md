# dogeared
A Chrome extension that puts cute dogs on your new tab pages. Heavily inspired by [Tabby Cats](http://tabbycats.club/). I'm much more of a dog lover than a cat person and felt the world deserved the adorable-ness of Tabby Cats but with dogs. No plagiarism is intended and all resources are coded and drawn from scratch.

## Roadmap
See the [issues](https://github.com/jessemillar/dogeared/issues) for a feel of where this will go.
